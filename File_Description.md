# Special_Topics_Astro 

1) Lagrange Points.py
This consists of WP1-2.

2) nn_dataset_generation
This is a code which imports the generated manifolds of the Lagrange Points.py file, computed the Euclidean Norm and saves this data in 2 large csv files (training, testing) for ANN training. Efficiently generating data using the special spatial distance function. 

3) ANN_Training
ANN architecture implementation, training and graphic visualtisation of outcomes
